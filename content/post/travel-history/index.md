There is an old saying in China: 
That is exactly what I like. Coming from a nation with a long history, I always like to guide my spirits back to the ancient and try to explore the evolution of the human society. I have traveled to many places of interests in China, Germany, Austria, US and etc. Impressed by the beauties as I am, all the experiences have made me thought deeper in philosophy and be a wiser man.
