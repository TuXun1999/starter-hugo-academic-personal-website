In this project, my works involve:
1. help to test and deploy the equipments to collect data, including Blackfly cameras, event cameras, duro-inertial units (including an antenna and an IMU unit)
2. test the calibration methods on IMU, cameras, gnss-lidar pairs and etc. 
3. help to complete post-processing tasks to generate the ground-truth trajectories
4. test existing SLAM algorithms (including ORB-SLAM3 and DSM) on the collected images and evaluating
